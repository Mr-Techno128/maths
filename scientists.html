                        Hilbert discovered and developed a board range of fundamental ideas in many
                        areas, including invariant theory, the calculus of variations, 
                        communicative algebra, algebraic number theory, the foundations of geometry, 
                        special theory of operators and it’s application to integral equations, 
                        mathematical physics and the foundations of mathematics.

                        was a German mathematician who made contributions to analysis,
                         number theory, and differential geometry.
                          In the field of real analysis,
                           he is mostly known for the first rigorous formulation of the integral,

                            and his work on Fourier series. His contributions to complex analysis include
                             most notably the introduction of Riemann surfaces,
                              breaking new ground in a natural,

                        was a Khwarazmian Iranian scholar and polymath during the Islamic Golden Age. He has been called variously the (Founder of Indology), (Father of Comparative Religion), (Father of modern Geodesy) and the first anthropologist. Al-Biruni was well versed in physics, mathematics, astronomy and natural science, and also distinguished himself as a historian, chronologist and linguist. He studied almost all the sciences of his day and was rewarded abundantly for his tireless research in many fields of knowledge.

                        was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher and Catholic writer. He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. Pascal’s earliest mathematical work was on conic sections; he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16. He later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines (called Pascal’s calculators and later Pascalines), establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.

                        A German-born theoretical physicist who's considered one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.

                        His intellectual achievements and originality led to "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".in 1905, a year sometimes referred to as his annus mirabilis , Einstein published four seminal papers.

                        Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.

                        Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.

                        In them, he established the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and proved the equivalence of massand energy.

                        an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author (described in his time as a "natural philosopher"), widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists and among the most influential scientists of all time.

                        He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment.

                        His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics.

                        Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.
